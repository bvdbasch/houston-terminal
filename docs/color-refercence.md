# Houston-terminal color palette reference
> [!CAUTION]
> While you can set every named color to a entirely different color (for example swapping orange for blue), this may yield unexpecterd result such as bad legibility.

Most terminal emulators have the option to configure your own color palette. When such an option is based on the standard 16 ANSI colors these configuration options are either named (for example `green`), or are numbered from `0` to `15`. Regardless of the configuration options available to you in your terminal emulator, the ANSI 16-color palette operates under the same assumptions; `0` for `black`, `1` for `red`, and so on.

The table below lists the index number and the corresponding standard name toghether with the hex code and rgb codes that make up the houston-terminal theme. By using the values in this table way you should be quickly configure your terminal with the houston-terminal color pallette and ensure that the visual style remains broadly the same across different terminals.
